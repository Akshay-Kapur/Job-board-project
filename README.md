Job-board-project
=================

It is a simple Job board function website using php, mysql and html-css. It has a login/add new user page, a job postings display page and a add jobs form. You can also click on a posted job to see its full detail. It is minimal beginner level code needed for these functions. I may add changes to improve the project as I learn more.The new/existing users are able to login/logout by setting up/terminating a session.
